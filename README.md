Spacetoon is a popular old kid's Tv channel in the arab speaking world.

It sure has a sweet spot in the hearts of many young adults, its old themes and shows always have a nostalgic feel to them. 

So Fellow spacetoon watchers, Go on a nostalgic trip playing several mini-games to reconstruct the logo of one of our favorite TV channels.

Game 1 : (controls)

just like the great captains of space in "thunder jet", fight over 60 enemies to move to the next game.

-Space bar : to shoot 
-Up, down, left, right : to Move

Game 2 : 

One thing is sure Pirates love gold (we can't blame them for that) , try to collect a minimum of 14 gold coins to go to the next game.

-Only move right and left 
-Avoid monsters 

Game 3 :

  Conan has always been very keen and attentive to details, try to find all the objects missing object in 200 s (3 min 33 s) 

-Click on the object you want 
-3 wrong clicks = -20 sec
